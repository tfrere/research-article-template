# Robot Learning: A Tutorial

Google "robot learning tutorial", and you will spend just as much time skimming through sources as actually learning about robot learning.
This tutorial solves this: a unified entry point to the field of robot learning, presenting the conceptual underpinnings of popular approaches in the field, as well as presenting practical examples of how to use SOTA algorithms in `lerobot`, an open-source library for full-stack robotics.
