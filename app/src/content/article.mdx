<Sidenote>
  Welcome to this single‑page **research article template**. It helps you publish **clear**, **modern**, and **interactive technical writing** with **minimal setup**. Grounded in **web‑native scholarship**, it favors **interactive explanations**, careful notation, and **inspectable examples** over static snapshots.
  
  It offers a **ready‑to‑publish, all‑in‑one workflow** so you can **focus on ideas** rather than infrastructure.

## Introduction
The web affords explanations that static PDFs cannot: **reactive diagrams**, progressive notation, and exploratory views that reveal how ideas behave. Use **interactive fragments** so readers can hover, scrub, and inspect—building **intuition** rather than merely reading results.

Precise notation, thoughtful visual encodings, and small, **manipulable experiments** deepen understanding. Treat these artifacts as **first‑class** alongside text, math, and code to help readers grasp mechanisms, limits, and trade‑offs.

Not every contribution fits a PDF. Treat demos, visualizations, and interactive write‑ups as scholarship: cite and version them, and ship clear, inspectable examples that expose intermediate states and link to sources so readers can verify and reproduce results.

This project is heavily inspired by [**Distill**](https://distill.pub) (2016–2021), which championed clear, web‑native scholarship.
