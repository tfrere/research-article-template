## Writing Your Content

### Introduction

Your article lives in two places

- `app/src/content/` — where you can find the `article.mdx`, `bibliography.bib` and html fragments.
- `app/src/assets/` — images, audio, and other static assets. (handled by git lfs)

The `article.mdx` file is a markdown file with html. It is the main file that contains your article.

<small className="muted">Example</small>
```mdx
{/* HEADER */}
---
title: "This is the main title"
subtitle: "This will be displayed just below the banner"
description: "A modern, MDX-first research article template with math, citations, and interactive figures."
authors:
  - "John Doe"
  - "Alice Martin"
  - "Robert Brown"
affiliation: "Hugging Face"

{/* CONTENT */}
# Hello, world

This is a short paragraph written in Markdown. Below is an example image:

<Image src={placeholder} alt="Example image" />
```

### Markdown 

You can use **markdown** to write your content. Here is the complete [markdown documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

<small className="muted">Example</small>
```mdx
# This is the main title

This is a short paragraph containing **bold** and *italic* text.

## This is a second level heading

- This is a list item
- This is a second list item
- This is a third list item
```


### Chapters


**If** your article becomes **too long** for one file, you can **organize** it into **separate chapters**.

Simply **create a new file** in the `app/src/content/chapters` **directory**.  
Then, **include** your new chapter in the main article.


<small className="muted">Example</small>
```mdx
import MyChapter from './chapters/my-chapter.mdx';

<MyChapter />
```

You can see an example of this in the <a target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/tfrere/research-article-template/blob/main/app/src/content/chapters/best-pratices.mdx">app/src/content/chapters/best-pratices.mdx</a> file.

### Table of contents
 
The **Table of contents** is generated **automatically** from your **H2–H4** headings. Keep headings **short** and **descriptive**; links work on **desktop** and **mobile**.

### Theme

All **interactive elements** (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.) are themed with the **primary color** you choose.

You can **update this main color** to match your brand by changing the `--primary-color` variable in the `app/src/styles/_variables.css` file.

Use the **color picker** below to see how the primary color affects the theme.

#### Brand color

  <HtmlFragment src="color-picker.html" />
  <Fragment slot="aside">
    You can use the color picker to select the right color.
    
    Here is an example of an <a href="#">interactive element</a>.
  </Fragment>
</Aside>


#### Color palettes

Here is a suggestion of **color palettes** for your **data visualizations** that align with your **brand identity**. These palettes are generated from your `--primary-color`.
