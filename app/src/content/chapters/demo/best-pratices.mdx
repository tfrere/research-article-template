## Writing Tips

Simple guidelines to make your research writing clear, engaging, and effective. Focus on what matters most: helping readers understand your ideas quickly and completely.

### Short sections
Break content into **small, purpose‑driven sections**. Each section should answer a **single question** or support one idea. This improves **scanability**, helps readers navigate with the TOC, and makes later edits safer.

### Clear, minimal annotations
Favor **concise captions** and callouts that clarify what to look at and why it matters. In code, **highlight just the lines** that carry the idea; avoid verbose commentary. **Precision beats volume**.

### Explain math notation
**Introduce symbols and variables** the first time they appear, and prefer **well‑known identities** over custom shorthand. When formulas carry the message, add one sentence of **plain‑language interpretation** right after.


<div className="note-grid" style="display:grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr)); gap: 12px; align-items: start;">
  <Note>
    For example, in linear regression with features $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$, weights $w \in \mathbb{R}^d$, and bias $b$, the prediction is:

    $$
    \hat{y} = w^\top x + b
    $$

    A common training objective is the mean squared error over $N$ samples:

    $$
    \mathcal{L}(w,b) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (w^\top x_i + b - y_i)^2
    $$

    Interpretation: the model fits a hyperplane that minimizes the average squared prediction error.

### Use the right chart

Picking the right visualization depends on your goal (compare values, show distribution, part-to-whole, trends, relationships, etc.). The Visual Vocabulary poster below provides a concise mapping from **analytical task** to **chart types**.
