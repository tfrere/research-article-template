## Vibe coding charts

<Note emoji="⚠️" variant="danger">This is a work in progress. It may change quickly.</Note>

### Prompt

This page explains how to use the directives to author D3 charts as self‑contained HTML fragments.
Using claude code works better.

The goal is to make **responsive**, **accessible**, **interactive** and **dark mode ready** charts.

1. Use this ref a a baseprompt: `app/src/content/embeds/vibe-code-d3-embeds-directives.md`.
2. Opt: use an already existing chart as a starting point.
3. Ask claude to code the chart. Here's a typical prompt:

```markdown
I want you to code a new d3 chart named `yourchart`.
I have one CSV file called `yourdata.csv` in the data folder.
The csv has the following columns: `x`, `y`, `z`.
I want you to code a d3 chart that visualizes the data.
```

4. Once the chart created, iterate with littles adjustments to make it better.
5. And that's it! 🎉

### Base examples

These are fundamental chart types that serve as building blocks for more complex visualizations. You can find all the source code in `app/src/content/embeds`.
