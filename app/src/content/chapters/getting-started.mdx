<br/>
<small className="muted">- A [slug-title].pdf and thumb.jpg are also generated at build time. You can find them in the public folder.</small>


### Deploy

The recommended way is to **duplicate this Space** on **Hugging Face** rather than cloning it directly:

1. Open the template Space: **[ðŸ¤— science-blog-template](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tfrere/science-blog-template)** and click **"Duplicate this Space"**.
<Note>ðŸ’¡ It runs on a **free** CPU basic instance.</Note>
2. Give it a name, choose visibility, and **keep the SDK as Docker**.
3. Then push your changes to your new Space repo.<br/>**Every push automatically triggers a build and deploy** on Spaces.

```bash
git clone git@hf.co:spaces/<your-username>/<your-space>
cd <your-space>
# Make edits locally, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Update content"
git push
```
