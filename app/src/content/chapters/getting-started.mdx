import Aside from '../../components/Aside.astro';

## Getting Started

### Installation

<Aside>
```bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull
cd app
npm install
```
<Fragment slot="aside">
    You can also use yarn.
  </Fragment>
</Aside>


### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Serving the `dist/` directory on any static host is enough to deliver the site.

A [slug-title].pdf and thumb.jpg are also generated at build time. You can find them in the public folder.

### Deploy

The recommended way is to **clone this [ðŸ¤— Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tfrere/science-blog-template)**.  

Once you have cloned the Space, **just push your changes** to your repository.  

**Every push automatically triggers a build and deploy** â€” no extra configuration needed.
