import Aside from '../../components/Aside.astro';

## Getting Started

### Installation

<Aside>
```bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull
cd app
npm install
```
<Fragment slot="aside">
    You can also use yarn.
  </Fragment>
</Aside>


### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Serving the `dist/` directory on any static host is enough to deliver the site.

A [slug-title].pdf and thumb.jpg are also generated at build time. You can find them in the public folder.

### Deploy

The recommended way is to **duplicate this Space on Hugging Face** rather than cloning it directly:

1. Open the template Space: **[ðŸ¤— science-blog-template](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tfrere/science-blog-template)** and click "Duplicate this Space".
2. Give it a name, choose visibility, and keep the SDK as **Docker** (this project includes a `Dockerfile`).
3. Then push your changes to your new Space repo. **Every push automatically triggers a build and deploy** on Spaces.

```bash
git clone git@hf.co:spaces/<your-username>/<your-space>.git
cd <your-space>
# Make edits locally, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Update content"
git push
```
