Welcome to this single-page research article template built with Astro and MDX. It’s designed to help you write clear, modern, and interactive technical articles with minimal setup. Whether you cover machine learning, data science, physics, or software topics, this template keeps the authoring flow simple while offering robust features out of the box.

Reading time: 10–15 minutes.

In this guide, you’ll learn how to install the template, write content (math, citations, images, code, asides, interactive fragments), customize styles and behavior, and follow a few best practices for publishing.

## Features

- Math via KaTeX (remark-math/rehype-katex)
- Citations and footnotes
- Responsive images with `astro:assets`
- Anchored headings and a generated table of contents
- Dark/light theme toggle
- HTML fragments for self-contained visualizations (e.g., Plotly)

## Getting Started

Installation:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Deployment: serve the `dist/` directory on any static host. A Docker/Nginx setup is included and works well on Spaces or similar environments.

Large assets: track binaries (e.g., `.png`, `.wav`) with Git LFS to keep the repository lean. This project is preconfigured to store such files via LFS.

## Writing Your Content

Author content in MDX. Below are minimal examples for the core elements.

### Math

Inline example: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$.

Block (scaled dot-product attention):

$$
\mathrm{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \mathrm{softmax}\!\left(\frac{QK^{\top}}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V
$$

```mdx
Inline: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$

Block:
$$
\mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\mathrm{softmax}\!\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V
$$
```

### Images

Responsive image using `astro:assets`:

<Image src={placeholder} alt="Responsive example image" />

```mdx
import { Image } from 'astro:assets'
import myImage from '../assets/images/placeholder.png'

<Image src={myImage} alt="Responsive example image" />
```

### Citations and notes

A short citation [@example2023]. A footnote[^note].

[^note]: Example footnote.

```mdx
As shown in [@example2023]. A footnote[^note].

[^note]: Example footnote.
```

### Interactive fragments

Plotly example (line):

<div className="plot-card">
  <HtmlFragment src="line.html" />
</div>

```mdx
import HtmlFragment from '../components/HtmlFragment.astro'

<HtmlFragment src="line.html" />
```

### Asides

<Aside>
  This paragraph presents a key idea concisely.
  <Fragment slot="aside">
    Side note for brief context or a definition.
  </Fragment>
  </Aside>

```mdx
import Aside from '../components/Aside.astro'

<Aside>
  Main paragraph with the core idea.
  <Fragment slot="aside">Short side note.</Fragment>
</Aside>
```

### Minimal table

| Method | Score |
|---|---|
| A | 0.78 |
| B | 0.86 |

```mdx
| Method | Score |
| --- | --- |
| A | 0.78 |
| B | 0.86 |
```

### Audio

<audio controls src={audioDemo}>
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

```mdx
import audioDemo from '../assets/audio/audio-example.wav'

<audio controls src={audioDemo}>
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
```

## Advanced Customization

- Styling: customize `src/styles/global.scss` for layout, typography, color scheme, and dark mode variables.
- Headings/TOC: tweak the TOC builder in `src/pages/index.astro` to match your preferred levels and behavior.
- Components: extend `components/` with bespoke MDX-friendly blocks (callouts, figures, widgets).
- Fragments: generate self-contained HTML fragments (e.g., Plotly) and include them via `<HtmlFragment src="..." />`.

## Best Practices

- Keep sections short and focused.
- Prefer vector or optimized images; use `astro:assets` for responsive delivery.
- Annotate figures and code minimally but clearly.
- Use math sparingly; explain notation on first use.

### Choosing the right chart

Picking the right visualization depends on your goal (compare values, show distribution, part-to-whole, trends, relationships, etc.). The Visual Vocabulary poster below provides a concise mapping from analytical task to chart types.

<figure>
  <Image src={visualPoster} alt="Visual Vocabulary: choosing the right chart by task" />
  <figcaption>
    Visual Vocabulary: a handy reference to select chart types by purpose (comparison, distribution, part-to-whole, correlation, and more).

  </figure>


## Conclusions

This template provides a practical baseline for writing and sharing technical articles with math, citations, and interactive figures. Start simple, iterate on structure and style, and keep content maintainable for future readers and collaborators.
